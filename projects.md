## Open source

Here is my [Github](https://github.com/acganesh) profile.

[`torcs-autopilot`](https://github.com/acganesh/torcs-autopilot): Deep reinforcement learning for simulated autonomous driving.  Stanford CS229 final project.

[`ChromaNet`](https://github.com/acganesh/ChromaNet): Deep learning for genomic chromatic profile prediction.  Stanford CS273B final project.

[`project-euler`](https://github.com/acganesh/project-euler): Solved ~140 mathematical and algorithmic problems on Project Euler.

## Books

In a past life, I was involved with math contests.  I have published two problem-books to guide student preparation: [108 Algebra Problems](https://bookstore.ams.org/xyz-5/), and [109 Inequalities](https://bookstore.ams.org/xyz-16/).
