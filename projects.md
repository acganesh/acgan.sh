[`ChromaNet`](https://github.com/acganesh/ChromaNet): Deep learning for genomic chromatic profile prediction.  Stanford CS273B final project.

[`project-euler`](https://github.com/acganesh/project-euler): Solved ~140 mathematical and algorithmic problems on Project Euler.

## Books

I have been involved with math Olympiads, and have written two problem books to guide student preparation.

[108 Algebra Problems](https://bookstore.ams.org/xyz-5/), with Dr. Titu Andreescu, published with XYZ Press.

[109 Inequalities](https://bookstore.ams.org/xyz-16/), with Dr. Titu Andreescu, published with XYZ Press.
