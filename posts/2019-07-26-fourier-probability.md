## Fourier transform of a group

*Definition.* Let $P$ be a probability on $G$.  The Fourier transform of $P$ at the representation $\rho$ is the matrix
$$
\hat{P}(\rho) = \sum_{s} P(s) \rho(s).
$$

*Definition.* Let $f, g : G \to \mathbb{C}$.  Then the convolution of these functions is defined as
$$
(f * g)(a) = \sum_{b \in G} f(ab^{-1}) g(b).
$$
