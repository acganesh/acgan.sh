# The modern algorithmic toolbox

These notes are based on an influential course I took at Stanford, [CS168: The Modern Algorithmic Toolbox](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/index.html), taught by [Greg Valiant](https://theory.stanford.edu/~valiant/) in Spring 2018.

## Modern hashing

## Data with distances

## Generalization and regularization

## Linear-algebraic techniques

## Spectral graph theory

## Sampling and estimation

## The Fourier perspective

## Sparse vector / matrix recovery

## Privacy-preserving computation
