# P贸lya-Burnside enumeration in combinatorics

## A class of problems

The following problem in chemistry is historically significant, as G. P贸lya originally popularized his theory through applications in chemical enumeration.  How many different chemical compounds can be made by attaching $H$, $CH_3$, or $OH$ radicals to each of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring pictured below?

Here are other problems that can be approached using P贸lya-Burnside.

- In how many ways can an $n \times n$ tablecloth be colored with $k$ colors?

- How many different necklaces can be made with $n$ beads and $k$ colors?

- How many ways can the faces of a polyhedrons be colored using at most $n$ colors?

- Find the number of simple graphs with $n$ vertices, up to isomorphism.

These problems share a common theme of enumerating the number of objects with some equivalence under *symmetry.*

... (need to port the rest).

Test.
