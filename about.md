<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm Adithya.  I'm a student in math and computer science at Stanford.  My academic interests include compilers and generative models.  I currently teach CS43 at Stanford, and serve as editor for The Gradient.  Previously, I was a 2014 Thiel Fellow. In my spare time, I play the piano and violin.</p>
