<p>Hello, I'm Adithya.  I'm a student in math and computer science at Stanford.  My academic interests include compilers and generative models.  I currently teach CS43 at Stanford, and serve as editor for The Gradient.  Previously, I was a 2014 Thiel Fellow.  I have been involved in the math competitions communities, and have published two books with XYZ Press.  In my spare time, I play the piano and violin.</p>
