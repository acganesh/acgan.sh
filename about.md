<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Adithya<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">My friends call me Adi.</span>.</p>


<p>I am currently a software engineer on the perception team at [Nuro](https://nuro.ai/). I cofounded and serve as editor for [The Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/)</p>

<p>While at Stanford, I taught Stanford's [CS43](cs43.stanford.edu).  Previously I worked on computer vision at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), genomics at [Counsyl](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/counsyl) (acq. Myriad Genetics 2018), and wrote [books](https://bookstore.ams.org/authors@AuthorsSearch=%20Ganesh%2C%20Adithya) for math competitions.  I was a 2014 [Thiel Fellow](https://thielfellowship.org/).</p>

<p>In my spare time, I play and compose music on piano and violin.</p>
