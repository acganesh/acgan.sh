<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Adi.  I study math at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/).  I am curious about probability theory, writing well, and programming languages.  I currently teach [CS43 (Functional Programming Abstractions)](https://stanford-lambda.gitlab.io/) at Stanford and serve as an editor for [The Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/).  Previously, I worked on computer vision at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), genomics at [Counsyl](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/counsyl) (acq. Myriad Genetics), and wrote [books](https://bookstore.ams.org/authors@AuthorsSearch=%20Ganesh%2C%20Adithya) for math competitions.  I was a 2014 [Thiel Fellow](https://thielfellowship.org/).  In my spare time, I play and compose music on piano and violin.</p>
