<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Adithya<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">My friends call me Adi.</span>.</p>

<p>I study math and theoretical computer science at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/).</p>

<p>When deciding what to work on, I choose problems that seem important for the long-term future.  I am currently interested in programming languages, distributed computing, and probability theory.</p>

<p>I am teaching Stanford's [CS43 (Functional Programming Abstractions)](https://stanford-lambda.gitlab.io/) (Winter 2020). I cofounded and serve as editor for [The Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/)<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>.<span class="sidenote">Disclosure: The Gradient is a student-run, non-profit publication with no external funders as of this writing.</span> Previously, I worked on computer vision at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), genomics at [Counsyl](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/counsyl) (acq. Myriad Genetics 2019), and wrote [books](https://bookstore.ams.org/authors@AuthorsSearch=%20Ganesh%2C%20Adithya) for math competitions.  I was a 2014 [Thiel Fellow](https://thielfellowship.org/).  In my spare time, I play and compose music on piano and violin.</p>
