<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm Adithya.  I'm a student in math and computer science at Stanford.  I am curious about statistical inference, writing well, and programming languages.  I currently teach CS43 (Functional Programming Abstractions) at Stanford, and serve as editor for The Gradient.  Previously, I worked on computer vision at Tesla, genomics at Counsyl, and was a 2014 Thiel Fellow. In my spare time, I play the piano and violin.</p>
