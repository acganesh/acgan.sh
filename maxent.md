# Blog - Maximum Entropy

<span class="marginnote">The blog title is a nod to the [principle of maximum entropy](posts/2019-01-01-maximum-entropy.html).</span>

Welcome to my blog, which is an informal platform for ideas I'm thinking about.  My goal is to document my "back of the napkin" thoughts in mathematics, computer science, policy, and other curiosities.


## Mathematics and statistics

[The principle of maximum entropy](posts/2019-01-01-maximum-entropy.html)

## Computer science
