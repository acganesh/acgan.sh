Welcome to my blog, which is an informal platform for ideas I'm pondering.  My goal is for this to (eventually) span my "back of the napkin" thoughts in mathematics, computer science, and policy.

My posts are below.  When available, I have linked to published posts.  The unlinked articles are placeholders for drafts in progress.

## Mathematics and statistics

[Efficient Prime Counting with the Meissel-Lehmer Algorithm](posts/2016-12-23-prime-counting.html)

## Policy
